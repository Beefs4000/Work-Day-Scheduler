# Work-Day-Scheduler

In this project I was learning moment, local storage and expanding on Jquery. This is a workday scheduler, it allows you to store text in hours of you work day. It also gives you a friendly reminder when it is the weekend. The formatting could be a little better but I'm still learning bootstrap.
